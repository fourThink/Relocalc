# Relocalc

A resource for residents or businesses looking to move to Austin, TX. 
Let the app calculate a livability score for the area of your interest.

## Overview

Relocal is a Mithril/Express/Postgres/Browserify web application that taps into various Austin Open Data APIs using data from the [City of Austin Data Portal] (http://data.austintexas.gov).
Each address will produce a livability score based on an algorithm which uses the available data.
The end user will be able to compare the results of particular data for an address entered with Austin averages.
In addition, the user will be able to scale the importance of each element to receive a weighted result depending on 
the user's own priorities.
